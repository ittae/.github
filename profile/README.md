## Hi there 👋

This service started from a mistake I made in 2021.

I promised to eat something with her, but after some days, I forgot what to eat when I met, although I knew we were meeting.

I forgot the promise and told her to eat whatever I wanted, and she didn't feel good for what I forgot.

Of course, it was natural that she was upset because this experience was not the first or second time.

So I wanted to create a service where each other's schedule is shared.

I hope that through this service, people will connect each other with each other's time.

It will be made soon after passing the 42 Seoul Inner Circle, so please wait.
